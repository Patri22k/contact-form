## My process

### Built with

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5) - Semantic markup for structuring web content
- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) - Styling and layout
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on enhancing the user interface with responsive design using CSS and the Tailwind CSS framework. I learned to create responsive layouts without relying on additional libraries, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. Additionally, I implemented contact forms using React, which allowed for efficient state management and dynamic updates, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.

### Continued development

#### Improving Responsive Design Skills
While I have learned the basics of creating responsive designs with CSS and Tailwind CSS, I recognize that there is still much to master in this area. I aim to deepen my understanding of responsive design principles, explore advanced techniques, and practice creating more complex and adaptive layouts.
